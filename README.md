# ADDCOOR ( Address | Coordinates )
==========================================
Location onclick to Coordinates | Address to Coordinates

Very simple web-app, which can be used to convert Address to its coordinates, or to get the coordinates for any location by clicking on the map.
also you can get your current location coordinates ( be aware that this function will need to be allowed to access your location ).

I hope this simple app can help you guys if you are looking for something regards to the maps.

built using Leaflet / Openstreet maps.
any question you are so welcome to contact me.
enjoy, and have fun.
